# Navigation in Flutter

Navigation in Flutter is the process of moving from one screen or page to another. Flutter provides a comprehensive navigation system that allows you to easily navigate between screens in your app.

The Flutter navigation system is based on the Navigator class. The Navigator class provides a number of methods for navigating between screens, including:

- push(): This method adds a new route to the stack of routes managed by the Navigator.
- pop(): This method removes the top route from the stack of routes managed by the Navigator.
